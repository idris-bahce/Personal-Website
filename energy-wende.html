        <h2>Energy Transition of Germany</h2>
        <img src="./images/energy-transition.webp" alt="Energy Transition of Germany" class="img-fluid rounded my-3">
        <p>
        <p>
            Germany has put an important aim for his future. Until 2050 will Germany CO2 emission free. That is why it
            has to take important measures. Is it possible to generate all the energy that today Germany produces from
            renewable energy resources? Let us make a brain storm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think about a bicycle rider, that 10 hours long rides. What do you think, how much electricity he will
            generate? We can fairly say that 1 kWh. That is not so much. We can wash our clothes one time in 60 degrees,
            we can light a light bulb 10 hours or we can light an LED light 60 hours or we can take a hot shover 3
            minutes long. It corresponds to 100 ml of oil. With an electric car we can drive up until 6 km in city. But
            with this amount of oil with a combustion engine car we can just drive 1 or 2 km.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now let us think about the amount of energy that have been produced in Germany. We will divide this amount
            to the days in a year. Then we will divide it to the population of Germany. Now we have 120 kWh. That means
            120 riders should ride 10 hours a day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from riders we have sun, wind and water power. These three are the ultimate renewable energies. Atom
            power is not going to be included in this brain storm. We will concisely say that they are very expensive
            and nuclear waste is a great problem that is not yet to solve. But it would be more nature saving when we
            shut down the coal thermal power plants instead of already active nuclear plants in short term.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s see what can we do with solar energies. Our sun is very important for our world. Our lives are
            dependent on sun. We can be more dependent to this huge energy resource.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of energy producer in this area. Solar thermal energy or photovoltaic. First is not that
            much efficient in energy production. We will go on with last. Today photovoltaic panels can convert the 20%
            of the sun energy. So here there are much to do for the scientist. Its efficiency should be increased!
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if the 1.4% of the Germany would be covered with the photovoltaic panels that converts in average 50 %
            of the sun energy, we would have 25 kWh pro person! That is unfortunately not that much! But we have wind
            and water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some mind-blowing numbers about wind turbines. If we have 2 times faster wind, we produce 8 times
            energy. If we have 2 times more diameter, we produce 4 times more energy. If we build our wind turbine not
            100 meters but 200 meters, we produce 1.5 times energy. So, it seems pretty efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although there is a limit in wind energy that can not be passed, Benz-Limit. So, according to this theoretic
            law we cannot pass the efficiency of 59%. That means we can convert max. 59% energy of the wind. In order to
            produce 40 kWh pro person and day we should build 40 000 wind turbines to the land and 20 000 wind turbines
            to the sea. There are lots to do!
        </p>
        <p>
            What about water power? Today water powerplants can convert the water energy up until 90%. But
            unfortunately, Germany is not a water power plant country. Because there isn’t enough height in flowing
            waters.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, Germany produces 120 kWh pro day and pro person. But we made altogether 65 kWh. That means we have to
            reduce the energy production. That does not mean that we will not drive cars and use electricity. We will do
            it just more efficient way. We will drive electric cars and we will heat our homes with heat pumps.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have other problems too. What renewable energy resources can produce is a fluctuating energy. That means
            sometimes it produces very high energy above the demand but sometimes it produces nothing at all. To be able
            to solve this problem we have to develop better batteries or something that can conserve energy. In the
            future electricity production will be decentralized. It means we need better smart grids and better ways to
            divide electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
            All these problems have to be solved. Germany and all the world have to be CO2 neutral. We must do this.
            Other way there are much more big troubles and catastrophes are waiting for us. Believe me these will cause
            in future much more money than today.
        </p>
        <p>
            We need more engineers and scientist who can find solutions to these problems. These solutions will
            definitely contain AI solutions. We have to see the problems wider and we have to think wider to overcome
            these problems and do what engineer do for years. We will make things more efficient!
